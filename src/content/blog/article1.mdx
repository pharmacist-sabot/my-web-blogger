Welcome to my first blog post! This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), a new kind of static site builder.

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro because of its focus on **performance** and **developer experience**. It ships zero JavaScript by default, which makes the site incredibly fast.

<InfoBox title="Pro Tip!">
  You can now use interactive components directly in your posts. This is the power of MDX!
</InfoBox>

Here is a small code example:

```javascript
// This is a javascript code block
function hello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
